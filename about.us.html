                        Hello, welcome to my webpage, This webpage consists of some of the things i've accomplished & have interests in. I was born & raised in

                        I Fell in love with playing video games at an early age (6 years old). I started having interest in sports when i became a teenager, especially football. My favorite football team was the <a href="https://www.patriots.com/">New England Patriots.</a> I love exotic vehicles that are structured for sports model vehicles. In the year 2019, i grew an interest in driving Commercial Vehicles, & accomplshed my goal of obtaining my Commercial Class A driver's license by the year 2021.Today i am now curious & interested in learning to become a Software Developer Engineer.
